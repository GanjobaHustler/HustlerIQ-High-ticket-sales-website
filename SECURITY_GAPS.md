# Security Gaps and Limitations

## Repository Plan/Permission Restrictions

| Feature | Status | Limitation | Required Plan/Role |
|---------|--------|------------|------------------|
| Private Vulnerability Reporting | ❌ Not Available | Public repository limitation | Private repository or GitHub Enterprise |
| Secret Scanning Non-Provider Patterns | ❌ Disabled | Advanced pattern detection | GitHub Advanced Security |
| Secret Scanning Validity Checks | ❌ Disabled | Real-time secret validation | GitHub Advanced Security |
| Merge Queue | ❓ Unknown | Repository scaling feature | GitHub Enterprise |
| Environment Protection Rules | ❓ Unknown | Deployment environment controls | Repository admin access |

## Code Scanning Configuration

| Item | Current State | Gap Analysis |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| Default Setup | Not Configured | Using custom CodeQL workflow instead |
| CodeQL Languages | JavaScript/TypeScript | Coverage appropriate for repository |
| SARIF Upload | Multiple tools | No conflicts detected |

## API Access Limitations

```bash
# Attempted API calls and responses:
# gh api repos/:owner/:repo/vulnerability-alerts --method GET
# Response: No explicit error - feature may not be available for public repos

# gh api repos/:owner/:repo/merge-queue
# Not tested - requires specific repository configuration
```

## Recommendations

1. **Private Vulnerability Reporting**: Consider making critical repositories private to enable coordinated disclosure
2. **Advanced Security Features**: Evaluate GitHub Advanced Security license for enhanced secret scanning
3. **Environment Protection**: Configure deployment environments with required reviewers
4. **Merge Queue**: Implement for high-traffic repositories to prevent merge conflicts
